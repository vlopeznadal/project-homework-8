Project Homework #8

You're half way through Sprint 2! Record your progress in Frodo 
using the template below and review with your adviser in your 
next advising session.

## Sprint 2: Part 1 -- Project Update
### I have completed my MVP (yes/no): yes

### I have completed these features: Users can search for a cafe near them, Users can view a list of cafes and details about each cafe, Users can view a map of the results, Users can register and login, Users can save cafes to profile by favoriting them, Users can view reviews from both Yelp and Google, Users can write their own cafe review/rate it, Users can change their profile picture

### This next phase, I plan to work on: cleaning up code, commenting, testing

### My general work plan/estimate for the rest of Sprint 2 is: Be done with it all by Wednesday, if not continue during the next week.
